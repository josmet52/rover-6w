Use this folder as a collection for commonly used screws.

!!!DO NOT RENAME SCREWS OR FOLDERS!!!
!!!Otherwise assemblies, that use the screws will brake!!!

How to add screws:
1.
Go to link specified in folder (Socket, Button, etc):

OR
Find a new screw type from:
https://de.misumi-ec.com/

OR
Model it yourself

(1.5)
Create new folder for screw type and document link, as done in the other folders.

2.
Find fitting screw.
Screws manufactured by MISUMI are preferred. The resulting CAD file can be generated and will be much smaller as it contains a parasolid instead of all the SolidWorks features.

3.
Download CAD (with account) and put the single *.SLDPRT file into the fitting location.
